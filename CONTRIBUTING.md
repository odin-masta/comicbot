# Contributing to Comicbot

This project has some value in learning to improve code, and so contributions are most welcome!

1. Check out the issues, find one you would like to work on, or make a new one.
   - In case of an existing issue, please comment or contact the maintainer(s) in some fashion, as there may be others already working on the issue.
   - In case of a new issue, please make sure maintainer(s) approve of the suggestion before you undertake any major work, to avoid uneccessary work.
1. If the issue can be naturally divided in several tasks, it is preferred, as it results in more atomic changes.
1. To start work, create a new branch, using the naming convention `category/issue#-name-of-issue` such as `feature/2-contributing-guide`.
1. Once work is underway, create a Pull Request early to discuss the issue with maintainers and other contributors.

Final point: Suggest changes to this CONTRIBUTING guide using the same process. :)
